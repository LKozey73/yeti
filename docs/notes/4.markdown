# Publishing with Yeti

There will be no user interface for publishing in Yeti, at least from the start or written by me. What there will be is a library
containing the basic publishing functions, which you'll be able to use in your web app or what have you. This library will provide
the following:

* going over the data repo and (re-)generating webspace stuff

* checking for additions and/or changes

* sorting through the arrivals and *classifying* them (more on this later)

This leads to user authentication and authorization: SSH keys are pretty much painless, and something everyone uses every day.
So, for each author, just stick an SSH key in the repo and that's that sorted out. From that moment on she can publish via scp or
using any modern vcs. The latter gives me two things for free:

* an exact copy of the live website on any of my computers, where I can try things out, without having to deploy another install.

* offsite backups guaranteed to be in sync.

* ability to roll back changes in a cinch.
