yeti design notes, i
===

i've finally caved in and decided to write my own photo album software. i've been using [birch][1] for the past two years at [too many lights][2], and it has served me well, but now i want some more functionality and it isn't there. you could argue that i should just add it to birch, but the code is based around the cgi paradigm and i don't want to go there. it will be easier to write something new.

having looked around, i find it surprising that there's so little offer on this area. there seem to be two popular alternatives:

* people have bent [movable type][3] to do their bidding. this is mostly done through templates, and while it does take care of the publishing bit, it still knows nothing about the specifics of photography.
* [pixelpost][4]. it's written in php, enough said.

so i'll be rolling my own. this post is the first of a series on the design and the ongoing implementation. all these notes will be available with the code, in [github][5].

and now for something completely different.
